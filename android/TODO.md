## [android]

We can consider V1 ready once all of the task without V2 mark are completed.

### [ready for coding]


### [to refine]

- Add a contextual menu to queue albums and tracks (add to current playlist instead of replacing)
- We need to plan a "download" feature for albums and tracks
- Check that the behavior of the audio playback is system-friendly in terms of audio events (pause on focus lost, pause on headphones unplugged and such)
- Make a plan to introduce the user's playlist feature
- Once the listening stats are implemented, we can add a "jump back in" component in the home screen
